**Assignment 1**

_Advanced Computer Graphics (CMSC740), Fall 2023_

In the first assignment you'll:

- Setup your local environment and download the skeleton code.
- Familiarize yourself with the codebase and implement two simple components: a depths integrator and a camera

# 1. Local environment setup

## Python environment

Aris requires `Python 3.10`. You can get it in different ways, but the recommended method is:

- Setup a [Miniconda environment](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
  - **Highly recommended** for Windows users, also recommended for macOS and Linux users
  - First time: `conda create --name aris python=3.10`
  - To start working: `conda activate aris`

Students who *already have their favorite Python environment managers* can continue to use those.
In principle, you're free to setup or reuse any environment, as long as you can install all the required packages and work on the assignments. However, we can only help with Conda setups.

Within the Python environment, install the following packages:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
  - *GPU is not necessary.*
  - For assignment 1~4, CPU rendering is reasonably fast, and GPU is unlikely to make your code faster.
  - Later in the semester, you'll get access to a cluster with GPUs available. Details to be announced.
- OpenEXR (native library)
  - Conda users (_except_ Mac users), install [openexr](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openexr) via Conda
  - Mac users (Conda or not), install with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openexr)
  - Linux non-Conda users, install `libopenexr-dev`
- OpenEXR (Python binding)
  - Windows users, use Conda to install [openexr-python](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openexr-python)
  - Mac users, run these commands, even if you're using Conda:
    ```bash
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include/OpenEXR -I/opt/homebrew/include/Imath"
    export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/lib -L/opt/homebrew/lib/OpenEXR"
    pip install OpenEXR
    ```
    - Note: this assumes that your Homebrew is in the default location. Modify the paths as needed.
  - Linux users, use `pip install OpenEXR` (preferred; no exports needed) or Conda
- Install these with `pip install`, even if you're using Conda
  - One-liner command: `pip install hydra-core pillow opencv-python open3d tqdm plotly`
  - [hydra-core](https://pypi.org/project/hydra-core/)
  - [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
  - [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
  - [open3d](https://pypi.org/project/open3d/)
  - [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
  - [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
- Mac users, install `libomp` with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libomp)

- Run the following commands:
  ```bash
  pip uninstall ipywidgets
  pip install ipywidgets==7.7.2
  ```

To check your installations, try the following and make sure there isn't any `ImportError`:

```
$ python
>>> import torch, OpenEXR, cv2, tqdm, open3d, hydra, plotly
```

## Clone the code

Our code is provided as a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository, hosted on GitHub.
Clone the skeleton code and **checkout your own branch** following these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CMSC740-UMD/aris-renderer-student.git aris-renderer
cd aris-renderer
git checkout -b working
```

!!! WARNING
    Do not create a Fork on Github. Forks are public and put you in risk of academic dishonesty.

It's important that you work on your own branch. We may need to update the skeleton later, and the recommended workflow is that you update the `origin/master` branch and merge the changes to your own branch.

It's also recommended that you create a **private** repository, and set it as a separate remote in your local repository. You can then sync your `working` branch to backup your work or switch between multiple machines. Refer to [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) about remotes.

Once you setup VSCode, you can also install a Git extension (such as `Git Graphs`) to make your life managing remotes and merges easier.

## Download Data

Due to its size, the mesh and environment data is not included in the git repository. Download them from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lZ36xsJGmS9Y52xeqtHvM7vQVpXPJor0/view?usp=sharing).

After extracting your folder should look like:

```plain
.vscode/
aris/
config/
data/
  environments/
  meshes/
render.py
(...other files)
```

## Render an image

You are now ready to render an image! Run these commands to verify that you have completed environment setup successfully:

```bash
python render.py scene=cbox
python render.py scene=ajax_simple
```

You'll find the outputs in `outputs/[date]/[time]/output.png`. They should look like these:

![cbox-normals](images/a1/cbox-normals.png height="400px") ![ajax-normals](images/a1/ajax-normals.png height="400px")

## Visual Studio Code

!!! INFO
    While using VSCode is recommended, it's not required. Feel free to use any Python IDE you are already used to.

Before you start editing code, you need to also install an editor. The recommended and supported development environment in this class is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). In fact, Aris also include a bunch of VSCode configurations (in the `.vscode` folder) to help you code. After installing VSCode, do the following:

- Install the `Python` extension.
- Open the `aris-renderer` folder with VSCode.
- Open `render.py` from the left (explorer) panel.
- On the bottom-left corner, you'll probably see a Python interpreter found by VSCode (something like `3.10.12`). Click on it, and choose `Python 3.10.12 ('aris')` from the dropdown, i.e. the environment you've prepared in the previous steps.
- Install `pylint` when you see a prompt.
- Press `Shift+Alt+F` (`Shift+Opt+F` on mac). Install `autopep8` following the prompt.

From time to time, format your code with `Shift+Alt(Opt)+F` and organize your imports with `Shift+Alt(Opt)+O` (letter `O`). This makes it easier for you and us to read code and spot potential bugs.


# 2. Getting familiar with Aris

## Python and PyTorch

Python and PyTorch are the most popular tools in many research areas today, including graphics, vision, NLP, and more.
We developed Aris and this class in Python so that you can easily integrate deep learning methods in PyTorch and obtain cool results (in assignment 5 and your project).

If you're not already familiar with Python, there are many tutorials online. At the minimum, understand the following:

- Basic syntax, variables, control flows
- Functions
- Common data structures: lists, dicts, tuples
- Classes and inheritance
- Package imports

For PyTorch, you'll only need the concepts of Tensors and their operations for the first four assignments; see the [Official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html). You will need the rest of the tutorial for assignment 5, when you'll actually train something.

The [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html) is a useful reference to the large number of functions that PyTorch provides, mostly under `torch.*` and `torch.nn.functional.*`, such as:

- Creating tensors filled with zeros, ones, or random values from uniform / Gaussian distributions
- Sum a tensor along a dimension
- Concatenate and stack tensors
- Normalize each of the `N` vectors in a `(N, 3)` tensor

_Indexing_ the tensors is also very important. PyTorch tensors are similar to Numpy arrays in this context so most of [this Numpy tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html) works with PyTorch as well.

**VSCode has built-in jupyter notebook support.** You can create a `playground.ipynb` to play with PyTorch, quickly test some functions, or debug your code.

### PyTorch practices

!!! INFO
    For this section, feel free to share and discuss your code in public (like in a Piazza post).

Do the following PyTorch practices, without writing any loops. This is optional but recommended, especially if you're not familar with PyTorch.

- Create this `(3, 3)` tensor. (1 line except for printing)
  ```python
  tensor([[1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]])
  ```
- Create a uniformly random `(10,)` tensor, get the indices and values of the items smaller than 0.5. (3 lines)
  ```python
  a = tensor([0.4079, 0.6167, 0.0590, 0.3589, 0.0748, 0.9924, 0.6027, 0.5810, 0.7485, 0.5522])
  b = tensor([0, 2, 3, 4])
  c = tensor([0.4079, 0.0590, 0.3589, 0.0748])
  ```
- Create a uniformly random `(10,)` tensor, set all items greater than 0.5 to zeros. (2 lines)
  ```python
  tensor([0.8141, 0.7350, 0.2277, 0.4472, 0.7580, 0.9014, 0.1368, 0.6306, 0.3223, 0.9906])
  tensor([0.0000, 0.0000, 0.2277, 0.4472, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.1368, 0.0000, 0.3223, 0.0000])
  ```
- Create a random `(3, 3)` tensor $M$ and a `(10, 3)` tensor $V$, compute a `(10, 3)` $Y$ such that $Y[i]=M V[i]$. That is, if we view $V$ and $Y$ both as 10 vectors in 3D, the $i$-th vector of $Y$ is the matrix multiplication of $M$ and the $i$-th vector of $V$. (3 lines)
  ```python
  M = tensor([[0.4244, 0.0574, 0.0552],
          [0.7129, 0.7412, 0.5561],
          [0.5477, 0.7566, 0.1634]])
  V = tensor([[0.3869, 0.3227, 0.7142], ...])
  Y = tensor([[0.2222, 0.9122, 0.5728], ...])
  ```
- Create a random `(10, 3)` tensor, and think of it as a batch of ten 3D vectors. Compute the norm of the vectors, so that you get a `(10, )` tensor. (1 line)

## Aris design and concepts

See [About Aris](about-aris.md.html) while browsing the code. Make sure you understand:

- The rendering pipeline in Aris
- How the normals integrator works
- How the perspective camera works

Ask any questions you have on Piazza or during office hours.

# 3. Simple extensions to Aris

!!! NOTE
    Sanity checks: each of the following task requires only 5~10 lines of code and _no loops_. If you find yourself writing loops, step back and rethink about batch operations.

## Depths integrator

Complete `aris/integrator/depths.py`, which should look similar to `normals`, but:

- Instead of using normals as colors, use the _inverse of depths_ ($1/t$) where the rays hit, and zeros for rays that go into the void.
- Depths are defined as the $t$ in $\textbf{p}=\textbf{o}+t\textbf{d}$, where $(\textbf{o}, \textbf{d})$ specifies the ray and $\textbf{p}$ is the intersection point.
- Note: depths are _not_ Euclidean distances between $\textbf{o}$ and $\textbf{p}$, because $\textbf{d}$ is not normalized for perspective camera.

Render two depths images with the following commands:

```
python render.py scene=cbox integrator=depths save_exr=true
python render.py scene=ajax_simple integrator=depths save_exr=true
```

The png files should look like these:

![cbox-depths](images/a1/cbox-depths.png height="400px") ![ajax-depths](images/a1/ajax-depths.png height="400px")

You can view the exr files with [tev](https://github.com/Tom94/tev). Zoom in to see the raw values.

## Thin lens camera

![whitted-front](images/a1/cbox-whitted-focus-front.png height="200px") ![whitted-back](images/a1/cbox-whitted-focus-back.png height="200px") ![path-front](images/a1/cbox-path-focus-front.png height="200px") ![path-back](images/a1/cbox-path-focus-back.png height="200px")

_Above: examples of the cbox scene rendered with whitted style tracer (left) and path tracer (right). You'll implement the integrators in assignment 3 and 4._

The perspective camera Aris has is an idea pinhole camera. In this exercise, you'll extend it to produce depth-of-field effects, as shown above.

The theory can be found in [this section of the PBR book](https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Camera_Models/Projective_Camera_Models#TheThinLensModelandDepthofField).

Complete `aris/camera/thin_lens.py`. A skeleton is already prepared for you - the `ThinLenseCamera` includes an instance of the `PerspectiveCamera` and stores two additional parameters: `aperture` and `focal_distance`. Follow the theory to complete the `image_to_rays` function, but note the following:

- The PBR book uses a function `ConcentricSampleDisk` that samples points uniformly on a 2D disk. In your code, simply sample points uniformly on a 2D square from $(-1,-1)$ to $(1,1)$. See [torch.rand](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.rand.html).

Render two images of `cbox` with different focal distances:

```
python render.py scene=cbox integrator=depths scene.camera.name=thin +scene.camera.config.aperture=0.3 +scene.camera.config.focal_distance=4.9 spp=256
python render.py scene=cbox integrator=depths scene.camera.name=thin +scene.camera.config.aperture=0.3 +scene.camera.config.focal_distance=5.59 spp=256
```

Your output should look like these:

![depths-front](images/a1/cbox-depths-focus-front.png height="400px") ![depths-back](images/a1/cbox-depths-focus-back.png height="400px")

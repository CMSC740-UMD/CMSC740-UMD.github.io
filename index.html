**CMSC740 Assignments**

This is the assignment homepage of the Advanced Computer Graphics class (CMSC740) in Fall 2024.

# Overview

In this class you'll be given 5 assignments that implements different parts of a path tracer in Python, by extending the skeleton of the *Aris Renderer*, which is an educational renderer developed for this class.
The renderer itself is written in Python with PyTorch, and you'll set everything up in the first assignment.

# Assignment submission

For every assignment you're expected to:

- Implement some tasks in code and produce some renderings or screenshots.
- Write a report in `reports/assignment-x` (follow instructions in the assignments and provided templates).
  - The report is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) format, which is an extension to Markdown. Click the link to learn about the features.
  - The code produce renderings in a folder inside `outputs`. **Make sure that you copy the final results (images) to reports/assignment-x folder**. Do NOT refer to a path in the `outputs` folder in your report.
- Use the provided script to create a zip file.
  - Run this command: `python make_submission.py x`, where **x** is the assignment number (1, 2, 3, ...).
  - The script gathers the required files and folders (`aris, config, reports/assignment-x, render.py, train.py`).
  - Do not zip your entire folder and submit. Points will be deducted if you submit any of your `.git, data, outputs` folders.
- The script produces `assignment-x.zip` in `outputs`. Submit the zip file on ELMS.
  - You should extract the file outside of your project folder and check your report with a browser to make sure that all images have been correctly included.

In the first assignment, you'll download the skeleton code that you'll work on for all the assignments.

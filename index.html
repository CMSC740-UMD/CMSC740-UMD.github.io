**CMSC740 Assignments**

This is the assignment homepage of the Advanced Computer Graphics class (CMSC740) in Fall 2023.

# Overview

In this class you'll be given 5 assignments that implements different parts of a path tracer in Python, by extending the skeleton of the *Aris Renderer*, which is an educational renderer developed for this class.
The renderer itself is written in Python with PyTorch, and you'll set everything up in the first assignment.

# Assignment submission

For every assignment you're expected to:

- Implement some tasks in code and produce some rendering or screenshots.
- Write a report in `reports/assignment-x` (follow instructions in the assignments and provided templates).
- The report is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) format and templates are provided. Click the link to learn about the features.
- Zip the entire `aris-renderer` folder (excluding `data` is preferred) and submit it to Canvas.

In the first assignment, you'll download the skeleton code that you'll work on for all the assignments. The skeleton already includes a `reports/assignment-1` folder that contains a template for the report of _Assignment 1_, and we'll add templates for other assignments when they're released.
